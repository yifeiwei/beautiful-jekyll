My name is Yifei Wei. I currently live in Jerusalem, Israel where I was a PhD candidate in Computational neuroscience, which means I need to find another place to continue my study. I had a M.Sc in biomedical engineering and a BS in bioengineering focusing in material science. I am interested in machine learning and neural networks (both artificial and biologically plausible), you can find codes of most of my works in my [github](https://github.io/yifeiwei/). 
- I am a music enthusiast.
- I am a sport enthusiast.
- I am a movie enthusiast.
- I like do some trading myself
- I am an economic and political news commentator
